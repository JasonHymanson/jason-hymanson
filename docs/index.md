Hi, I'm Jason

I am currently a student at UNC Wilmington concentrating in management information systems and business analytics. In my years of schooling I have learned many skills necessary for the business world including strong team work and critical thinking. I also learned ways to improve my creative thinking and grow my passion for the information technology field and analytics. I always try to question how I can do something better and use my creative abilities to come up with something that will surpass the competition.
